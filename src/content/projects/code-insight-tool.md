## Overview

The Code Quality Insight Tool is a web-based application designed to integrate with sonarQube servers across an organization to analyze code repositories and provide comprehensive insights on code quality, complexity, and maintainability. The tool aggregates data from multiple repositories, allowing development teams and management to monitor code health, identify technical debt, and prioritize refactoring efforts.

Built using Angular and Kendo UI for the frontend, the application offers an intuitive user interface for visualizing code metrics and trends. The backend is developed in Kotlin with Spring Boot, providing robust APIs for data retrieval and processing. PostgreSQL serves as the primary database for storing analysis results and user data. The entire application is containerized using Docker and deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to ensure scalability and high availability.


## Technical Highlights

- Modular monolithic architecture for simplicity and maintainability
- Websocket integration for real-time data updates
- RESTful API design for seamless communication between frontend and backend
- Reusable Angular components for consistent UI/UX
- Kendo UI for rich data visualization and interactive charts
- Comprehensive unit and integration testing for reliability

## Success Metrics

- Successfully integrated with multiple sonarQube servers across the organization
- Enabled teams to monitor code quality trends over time and identify areas for improvement
- Improved code maintainability by providing actionable insights and recommendations
- Achieved high user satisfaction with intuitive UI and responsive performance

The project was completed within a tight timeline of one months, demonstrating efficient project management and rapid development capabilities.
