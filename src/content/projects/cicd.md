## Overview

This project focuses on implementing Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) practices to streamline the software development lifecycle. By automating the build, test, and deployment processes, we aim to achieve faster delivery of high-quality software. The CI/CD pipeline is designed using Jenkins for automation, Docker for containerization, and Terraform for infrastructure as code. The deployment targets Amazon Web Services (AWS), utilizing services such as AWS ECS for container orchestration and AWS DynamoDB for database management.

## Key Features

- Automated Build and Test: Integration of automated build and test processes using Jenkins, ensuring that code changes are validated before deployment. This includes unit tests, integration tests, and code quality checks using SonarQube.
- Containerization: Use of Docker to create consistent and portable application environments, facilitating easier deployment across different stages of the pipeline.
- Infrastructure as Code: Implementation of Terraform to manage and provision infrastructure resources in AWS, enabling version
    control and repeatability.
- Continuous Deployment: Automated deployment of applications to AWS ECS, ensuring that new features and bug fixes are delivered to production quickly and reliably.
- Versioning and Release Management: Utilization of Semantic Release for automated versioning and release management, ensuring that releases are consistent and well-documented.

## Technical Highlights

### CI/CD Pipeline

- Jenkins: Configured Jenkins pipelines to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.
- GitHub Actions: Integrated GitHub Actions for triggering CI/CD workflows based on code changes in the repository.
- Gradle and npm: Used Gradle for building Java applications and npm for managing JavaScript dependencies and scripts.
- SonarQube: Integrated SonarQube for continuous code quality analysis and reporting.

### Containerization and Deployment

- Docker: Created Docker images for applications, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments.
- AWS ECS: Deployed Docker containers to AWS ECS, leveraging its scalability and management features.
- AWS DynamoDB: Utilized AWS DynamoDB for configuration storage for multi-tenant applications.

### Infrastructure Management

- Terraform: Developed Terraform scripts to provision and manage AWS resources, including ECS clusters, DynamoDB tables, and networking components.
- Version Control: Maintained infrastructure code in Git repositories, enabling collaboration and version tracking.
