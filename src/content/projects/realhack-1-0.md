## Overview

RealHack 1.0 is a web-based hackathon management platform designed to streamline the registration and team management processes for hackathon events. The platform allows to enter the participant details, manage teams and their meal selections, and provides real-time updates during the event. Built using a combination of Node.js, Express.js, and Socket.io for the backend, and jQuery for the frontend, RealHack 1.0 offers a user-friendly interface for both organizers and participants. The application also includes a mobile component developed in Android Studio to facilitate on-the-go access to event information.

In the registration desk, organizers can quickly scan participant QR codes to retrieve their choice of T-shirt size and meal preferences, ensuring a smooth check-in process. Teams can be created and managed easily, with real-time updates displayed on a dashboard for organizers to monitor team statuses and participant information.
