## Overview

The Warehouse Management System (WMS) Modernization project aims to revamp the existing legacy WMS used by a Fortune 100 company. The new system is designed to enhance operational efficiency, improve user experience, and provide real-time inventory tracking. This full-stack application integrates seamlessly with the company's ERP systems and supports high-volume transactions. Additionally, it incorporates advanced features such as omni-channel fulfillment, inventory optimization, AI-driven replenishment, directed tasking, and labor management to streamline warehouse operations.

The modernization effort focuses on replacing outdated technologies with a scalable and maintainable architecture. The frontend is built using React and Redux, providing a responsive and intuitive user interface for warehouse staff. The backend leverages Java with Spring Boot to handle complex business logic and ensure robust performance. Oracle is used as the primary database for its reliability and scalability. Node.js is utilized for certain microservices, enhancing the system's modularity. The application is containerized with Docker and deployed on AWS, ensuring high availability and scalability. Continuous integration and deployment are managed through Jenkins and Terraform, facilitating rapid development cycles and infrastructure as code.

## Technical Highlights

### Architecture

- Microservices architecture for modularity and scalability
- RESTful API design with various services communicating via HTTP/HTTPS
- Design patterns such as Repository, Service, and Factory for maintainability
- Reusable React components used across different modules
- Redux-based state management for predictable application state
- Comprehensive unit and integration testing for all components
- Containerization with Docker for consistent deployment environments
- CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and Terraform for automated deployments
- Multi-tenancy support for scalability across different warehouse locations
- Scalable cloud infrastructure on AWS with auto-scaling and load balancing

### Performance

- Optimized database queries and indexing
- Asynchronous processing for long-running tasks
- Load balancing and auto-scaling on AWS

### Security

- Role-based access control (RBAC) for user permissions
- LDAP integration for centralized authentication
- Static code analysis (Veracode) for vulnerability detection

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Reverse Engineering Legacy Systems**  
  - **Challenge**: Understanding and documenting the existing legacy WMS functionality
  - **Solution**: Conducted thorough code reviews and collaborated with domain experts to map out business processes

- **Performance Optimization**
  - **Challenge**: Meeting performance requirements during peak operational hours
  - **Solution**: Conducted load testing and optimized critical code paths, implemented caching strategies, and scaled infrastructure dynamically

- **User Adoption**
  - **Challenge**: Encouraging adoption of the new system among warehouse staff
  - **Solution**: Provided comprehensive training sessions and created user-friendly documentation to facilitate the transition

- **Monitoring and Maintenance**
  - **Challenge**: Ensuring system reliability and quick issue resolution post-deployment
  - **Solution**: Set up monitoring tools (Datadog) and alerting systems to proactively identify and address issues with L2/L3 support teams
  
- **Data Consistency Across Microservices**
  - **Challenge**: Ensuring data consistency across microservices
  - **Solution**: Implemented distributed transactions and eventual consistency patterns using message queues

## Results

- Deployed a modern WMS for 10+ warehouses across United States borderlines
- Saved 90% licensing costs by replacing legacy software with in-house solution
- Improved usability and reduced training time by 40% through intuitive UI/UX design
- Enhanced inventory accuracy by 25% with real-time tracking and AI-driven replenishment
- Achieved 99.9% system uptime with robust architecture and monitoring
- Scaled to handle 5x transaction volume during peak seasons with auto-scaling on AWS
