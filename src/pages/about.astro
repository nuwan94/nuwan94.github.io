    I'm Nuwan, a passionate developer with a love for technology and innovation. With {new Date().getFullYear() - 2021}+ years of industry experience and {new Date().getFullYear() - 2013}+ years of coding under my belt, I've honed my skills in various programming languages and frameworks.

  <p>Here are a few fun (or not so fun 😅) facts about me:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      I assembled 🛠️ my first computer at the age of 12 using the parts I
      collected from a junkyard.
    </li>
    <li>
      I started my journey as a self-taught developer. Visual Basic 6 🖤 was my
      first programming language.
    </li>
    <li>
      Started way back in web development with PHP and jQuery before the cool
      kids showed up with React and Angular. 👶
    </li>
    <li>
      Deployed web applications to cPanel in VPS before cloud ☁️ hosting became a
      thing.
    </li>
  </ul>
